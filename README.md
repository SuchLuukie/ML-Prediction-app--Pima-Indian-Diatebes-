# ML Prediction app (Pima Indian Diatebes)
 Machine learning app using the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset.

# What I learned from this project.
What I learned was how to manipulate a dataset to be able to work with the ML algorithm.
Also I learned a bit more about streamlit to be able to take inputs and easily return a value visually.


# Dataset used:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

# Libraries used:
sklearn - RandomForestClassifier (Machine learning) <br/>
streamlit - Visualization of data/prediction. <br/>
pandas - dataframe
